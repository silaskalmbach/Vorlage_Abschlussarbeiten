	abstract = {The artificial neural network ({ANN}) approach is a generic technique for mapping non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs without knowing the details of these relationships. This paper presents an application of the {ANN} in a building control system. The objective of this study is to develop an optimized {ANN} model to determine the optimal start time for a heating system in a building. For this, programs for predicting the room air temperature and the learning of the {ANN} model based on back propagation learning were developed, and learning data for various building conditions were collected through program simulation for predicting the room air temperature using systems of experimental design. Then, the optimized {ANN} model was presented through learning of the {ANN}, and its performance to determine the optimal start time was evaluated.},
